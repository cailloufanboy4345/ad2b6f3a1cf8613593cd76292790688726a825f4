to get rid of the videolist fetch error, you can go into requestly, go to rules, click on replace host, and then replace list.html with dashboard/videos.html
and that should fix the problem. if you don't know that i'm taking about, then <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cx2hY7f6Azm4lu6aXEAj-zbkz8FKN0tG/view?usp=sharing">click here.</a>
don't worry, that bug should be fixed anytime soon. for now, you have to use requestly for the fix.
